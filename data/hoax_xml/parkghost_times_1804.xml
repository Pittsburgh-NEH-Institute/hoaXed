            <p>This document is part of a larger digital collection of stories of ghost hoaxes from
               the 18th and 19th century London newspapers and periodicals. The project explores the
               beginnings of mass print media in a metropolitan area at a time when technology and
               education made reading increasingly common and inexpensive.</p>
            <p>The corpus holds 36 individual documents, which reflect a diverse mix of reporting on
               various hauntings in and around London between 1804 and 1889. The PDF and JPEGs from
               online databases were transcribed using ABBYFineReader OCR, then corrected and
               occasionally manually transcribed if document quality necessitated it. After
               normalization in plain text, all documents were upconverted to TEI XML.</p>

            <normalization>
               <p>Earlier texts have had some spelling normalization due to errors in OCR.
                  Typographic em dashes are longer than modern em dashes, so all dashes have been
                  normalized to modern em dash length.</p>
            </normalization>
            <quotation>
               <p>All extraneous white space used by printers to avoid overlapping with letters has
                  been removed. All quotes are simply tagged with the q tag.</p>

         <p>Yesterday <persName ref="#georgejones">George Jones</persName>, of Lieut.-Col. Taylorâ€™s Company of Coldstream Guards, whose
            declaration respecting the <rs ref="stjparkghost">Park Ghost</rs> we yesterday published, was brought before <persName ref="#richardford">Sir
            Richard Ford</persName>, to be interrogated respecting the sight he was supposed to have seen.
            Previous to his examination, <persName ref="stafford">Mr. Stafford</persName>, the Chief Clerk, endeavoured to find out
            whether his imagination had received any impressions from reading any dismal story, or
            if he had; at the time the phantom appeared to him, suffered the story of the <rs
               ref="hammersmithghost">Hammersmith Ghost</rs> to dwell on his mind, in order, if
            possible, <rs ref="mis">to ascertain if he had been misled by his fancies</rs>. To these questions he
            answered in the negative. On being asked respecting the strange object he had seen, he
            solemnly declared, that he was ready at any time to make oath to what he had stated, and
            that he firmly believed he had seen a ghost. He detailed every thing in Court as near as
            possible to what we yesterday inserted under his own signature.</p>
